This is a collaborative project between me and 4 other teammates, as we talk about Mumbai a densely populated coastal city, that experiences significant rainfall variations throughout the year. Accurate precipitation forecasting is vital to ensure sustainable energy generation, building energy efficiency, and agricultural productivity. However, existing forecasting models may not capture the nuances of Mumbai's unique climate. So, we built different forecasting models and concluded that the Multiplicative Seasonal model was the best with nearly 85% accuracy.

All the files are attached in the zip folder, along with the project report with all the details of how we proceeded to choose our best model.
